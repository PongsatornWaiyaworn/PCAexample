# PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Implementations

This repository demonstrates three different approaches to implementing **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:

1. **Detailed Step-by-Step PCA**: A manual, detailed implementation of PCA to understand how it works under the hood.
2. **PCA with RGB Images**: Applying PCA to reduce the dimensionality of RGB images for tasks like image compression or feature extraction.
3. **PCA using Scikit-learn**: Using the popular Python library **scikit-learn** to perform PCA with minimal code.
